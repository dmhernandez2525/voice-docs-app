# Talk Mode Guide

## What is Talk Mode?

Talk Mode enables continuous hands-free conversation with the AI assistant. No button clicking required - just speak naturally and the system handles the rest.

## How It Works

1. **Start Talk Mode** - Click "Start Talk Mode" button
2. **Grant Permissions** - Allow microphone access when prompted
3. **Begin Speaking** - Start your conversation naturally
4. **Automatic Processing** - System processes speech after 3 seconds of silence
5. **AI Response** - Answer is automatically spoken aloud
6. **Continue** - Microphone reactivates for your next question
